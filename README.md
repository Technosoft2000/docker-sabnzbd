## SABnzbd - The automated Usenet download tool ##

SABnzbd is an Open Source Binary Newsreader written in Python.

It's totally free, incredibly easy to use, and works practically everywhere.

SABnzbd makes Usenet as simple and streamlined as possible by automating everything we can. All you have to do is add an .nzb. 
SABnzbd takes over from there, where it will be automatically downloaded, verified, repaired, extracted and filed away with zero human interaction.

If you want to know more you can head over to the SABnzbd website: http://sabnzbd.org.

## Updates ##

**2017-02-05 - v1.1.2**
 * created a special base image ```technosoft2000/alpine-base``` with a pre-define init process for easier image creation & maintenance
 * sabnzbd image is based now on ```technosoft2000/alpine-base:3.5-1.0.0```
 * version information at sabnzbd's ```version.py``` gets updated at container startup
 * __SABNZBD...__ environment variables are changed to __APP...__
 * it's also possible to use sabnzbd tags as __APP_BRANCH__ input to checkout a specific tagged version

**2017-01-05 - v1.1.1**

 * code clean-up and enhanced the start script
  + new script ```checkout.sh``` used to clone & update sources via git, used for sabnzbd and nzbToMedia
 * new environment variables especially for nzbToMedia
  + NZBTOMEDIA_REPO for nzbToMedia GitHub repository
  + NZBTOMEDIA_BRANCH for nzbToMedia GitHub repository branch
 * upgrade of gosu from v1.9 to v1.10
 * __known issues__
  + sabnzbd shows at branch 1.1.x as version 'develop', 
    this is because of a unintended change at sabnzbd's ```version.py``` issued by a backport from the develop branch.
    Nevertheless it is the right version after the git clone and this issue is only an cosmetic issue.

  + ```image.description``` ... a short description of the docker image
  + ```image.date``` ... the creation/update date of the docker image e.g. 2017-01-04
  + ```url.docker``` ... the docker registry URL from where the docker image is distributed
  + ```url.github``` ... the github project URL of the docker image
  + ```url.support``` ... the support forum URL where you can reach me
 * Enhanced the logging information at container startup
  + on installation: git clone command is shown now with detailed information

  + if you use for example ```-v /volume1/docker/apps/sabnzbd/config:/sabnzbd/config``` change into directory 
    ```/volume1/docker/apps/sabnzbd/config/scripts``` to edit and configure autoProcessMedia.cfg

## Parameters ##

### Introduction ###
The parameters are split into two parts which are separated via colon.
The left side describes the host and the right side the container. 
For example a port definition looks like this ```-p external:internal``` and defines the port mapping from internal (the container) to external (the host).
So ```-p 8080:80``` would expose port __80__ from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port __8080__.
Accessing http://'host':8080 (e.g. http://192.168.0.10:8080) would then show you what's running **INSIDE** the container on port __80__.

### Details ###
* `-p 8080` - http port for the web user interface
* `-p 9090` - https port for the web user interface
* `-v /sabnzbd/config` - local path for SABnzbd config files; at `/sabnzbd/config/scripts` the post processing scripts are available
* `-v /downloads/complete` - the folder where SABnzbd puts the completed downloads
* `-v /downloads/incomplete` - the folder where SABnzbd puts the incomplete downloads and temporary files
* `-v /downloads/nzb` - the folder where SABnzbd is searching for nzb files - __optional__
* `-v /sabnzbd/nzbbackups` - the folder where SABnzbd puts the processed nzb files for backup - __optional__
* `-v /etc/localhost` - for timesync - __optional__
* `-e APP_REPO` - set it to the SABnzbd GitHub repository; by default it uses https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd.git - __optional__
* `-e APP_BRANCH` - set which SABnzbd GitHub repository branch you want to use, __master__ (default branch), __0.7.x__, __1.0.x__, __1.1.x__, __develop__ - __optional__
* `-e NZBTOMEDIA_REPO` - set it to the nzbToMedia GitHub repository; by default it uses "https://github.com/clinton-hall/nzbToMedia.git" - __optional__
* `-e NZBTOMEDIA_BRANCH` - set it to the nzbToMedia GitHub repository branch you want to use, __master__ (default branch), __nightly__, __more-cleanup__, __dev__ - __optional__
* `-e SET_CONTAINER_TIMEZONE` - set it to `true` if the specified `CONTAINER_TIMEZONE` should be used - __optional__
* `-e CONTAINER_TIMEZONE` - container timezone as found under the directory `/usr/share/zoneinfo/` - __optional__
* `-e PGID` for GroupID - see below for explanation - __optional__
* `-e PUID` for UserID - see below for explanation - __optional__

### Container Timezone

In the case of the Synology NAS it is not possible to map `/etc/localtime` for timesync, and for this and similar case
set `SET_CONTAINER_TIMEZONE` to `true` and specify with `CONTAINER_TIMEZONE` which timezone should be used.
The possible container timezones can be found under the directory `/usr/share/zoneinfo/`.

Examples:

 * ```UTC``` - __this is the default value if no value is set__
 * ```Europe/Berlin```
 * ```Europe/Vienna```
 * ```America/New_York```
 * ...

__Don't use the value__ `localtime` because it results into: `failed to access '/etc/localtime': Too many levels of symbolic links`

## User / Group Identifiers ##
Sometimes when using data volumes (-v flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user PUID and group PGID. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work" â„¢.

In this instance PUID=1001 and PGID=1001. To find yours use id user as below:

```
  $ id <dockeruser>
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```

## Additional ##
Shell access whilst the container is running: `docker exec -it sabnzbd /bin/bash`

Upgrade to the latest version of sabnzbd: `docker restart sabnzbd`

To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: `docker logs -f sabnzbd`
